# Can you tell/show me:
# 
# - How many times each number appears
# - Which number(s) appear(s) the most
# - Which number(s) appear(s) the least
# - The sum of all numbers
# - How many numbers there are total
# - Whether or not the total is prime
# - The average value (sum of all numbers / count of numbers)
# - All of the numbers sorted ascending
# - All of the numbers sorted descending (just using a sort function)
# - All of the numbers sorted descending (by reversing the array that's
# sorted ascending)
# - A list of unique numbers, sorted ascending (so [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
# 7])
# - An array representing the sum of each column (so [7, 6, 15, ...]
